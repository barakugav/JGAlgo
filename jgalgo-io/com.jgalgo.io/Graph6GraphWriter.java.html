/**
 * Write a graph in 'graph6' format.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * 'graph6' is a format for storing undirected graphs in a compact manner, using only printable ASCII characters. Files
 * in these format have text type and contain one line per graph. It is suitable for small graphs, or large dense
 * graphs. The format support graphs with vertices numbered 0..n-1 only, where n is the number of vertices, and edges
 * numbered 0..m-1 only, where m is the number of edges. A graph6 file contains a bit vector with {@code n (n - 1) / 2}
 * bits representing the edges of the graph. All bytes of a graph6 file are in the range 63..126, which are the
 * printable ASCII characters, therefore a bit vector is represented by a sequence of bytes in which each byte encode
 * only 6 bits.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The format does not support specifying the ids of the edges, therefore the writer will not write them. Nevertheless,
 * its possible to write and later read the graph using the {@link Graph6GraphReader} class while keeping the edges ids:
 * if the edges in the written graph are numbered 0..m-1, and when they are iterated from {@code 0} to {@code m-1} they
 * are also ordered by the order of the bit vector, then the reader will assigned the same ids to the edges. The order
 * of the bit vector and the format details can be found
 * &lt;a href=&quot;https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This way of keeping the edges ids is
 * enforced by the writer by default, but can be disabled by calling {@link #keepEdgesIds(boolean)} with {@code false}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The 'graph6' format is efficient for dense graph, for dense graphs the {@linkplain Sparse6GraphWriter 'sparse6'
 * format} should be used.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Self edges and parallel edges are not supported by the format.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * File with a graph in 'graph6' format usually have the extension {@code .g6}.
