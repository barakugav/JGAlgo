/**
 * Write a graph in 'digraph6' format.
 *
 * <p>
 * 'digraph6' is a format for storing directed graphs in a compact manner, using only printable ASCII characters. Files
 * in these format have text type and contain one line per graph. It is suitable for small graphs, or large dense
 * graphs. The format support graphs with vertices numbered 0..n-1 only, where n is the number of vertices, and edges
 * numbered 0..m-1 only, where m is the number of edges. A digraph6 file contains a bit vector with {@code n^2} bits
 * representing the edges of the graph. All bytes of a digraph6 file are in the range 63..126, which are the printable
 * ASCII characters, therefore a bit vector is represented by a sequence of bytes in which each byte encode only 6 bits.
 *
 * <p>
 * The format does not support specifying the ids of the edges, therefore the writer will not write them. Nevertheless,
 * its possible to write and later read the graph using the {@link Digraph6GraphReader} class while keeping the edges
 * ids: if the edges in the written graph are numbered 0..m-1, and when they are iterated from {@code 0} to {@code m-1}
 * they are also ordered by the order of the bit vector, then the reader will assigned the same ids to the edges. The
 * order of the bit vector and the format details can be found
 * <a href="https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.html">here</a>. This way of keeping the edges ids is
 * enforced by the writer by default, but can be disabled by calling {@link #keepEdgesIds(boolean)} with {@code false}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The 'digraph6' format support directed graphs only, for undirected graphs the {@linkplain Graph6GraphWriter 'graph6'
 * format} should be used.
 *
 * <p>
 * Parallel edges are not supported by the format.
 *
 * <p>
 * File with a graph in 'digraph6' format usually have the extension {@code .d6}.
