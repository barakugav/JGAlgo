/**
 * Compute the minimum-cost (max) flow in a flow network.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There are a few variations of the minimum-cost flow problem: (1) given source(s) and sink(s) terminal nodes, and the
 * objecting is to find the flow with the lowest cost out of all maximum flows. (2) given per-vertex finite supply, and
 * the objective is to find a minimum-cost flow satisfying the supply, namely that for each vertex the sum of flow units
 * going out of the vertex minus the sum of flow units going into it is equal to its supply.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * In addition to these variants, a lower bound for each edge flow can be specified, similar to the capacities which can
 * be viewed as upper bounds.
