/**
 * A discrete graph with vertices and edges.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A graph consist of a finite set of vertices \(V\) and edges \(E\). Vertices are some objects, and edges are
 * connections between the vertices, for example vertices can be cities and edges could be the roads between them. Edges
 * could be directed or undirected. Weights may be assigned to vertices or edges, for example the length of a road might
 * be a weight of an edge. Than, questions such as &quot;what is the shortest path between two cities?&quot; might be answered
 * using graph algorithms.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Each edge \(e=(u, v)\) in the graph has a &lt;i&gt;source&lt;/i&gt;, \(u\), and a &lt;i&gt;target&lt;/i&gt; \(v\). In undirected graphs the
 * 'source' and 'target' can be switched, as the edge is not directed, and we treat the source and target as
 * interchangeable &lt;i&gt;end points&lt;/i&gt;. If an edge \((u,v)\) exist in the graph, we say the vertices \(u\) and \(v\) and
 * &lt;i&gt;neighbors&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;adjacent&lt;/i&gt;. The edges are usually stored in some list for each vertex, allowing efficient
 * iteration of its edges. The &lt;i&gt;degree&lt;/i&gt; of a vertex is the number of its edges. In directed graph, we have both
 * &lt;i&gt;in-degree&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;out-degree&lt;/i&gt;, which are the number of edges going in and out the vertex, respectively.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Vertices can be added or removed. When a vertex \(v\) is removed, all the edges with \(v\) as one of their end points
 * are removed as well. Edges can be added as connection to existing vertices, or removed.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A directed graph and an undirected graph both implement this interface. In a directed graph, the edges are
 * &lt;i&gt;directed&lt;/i&gt; namely an edge \(e(u, v)\) will appear in the iteration of {@code edgesOut(u)} and {@code edgesIn(v)}
 * and will not appear in the iteration of {@code edgesOut(v)} and {@code edgesIn(u)}. In an undirected graph, the edges
 * are undirected, namely an edge \(e(u, v)\) will appear in the iteration of {@code edgesOut(u)}, {@code edgesIn(v)},
 * {@code edgesOut(v)} and {@code edgesIn(u)}. Also {@link #edgesOut(int)} and {@link #edgesIn(int)} are equivalent for
 * the same vertex, same for {@link #degreeIn(int)} and {@link #degreeOut(int)}, and similarly
 * {@link #removeEdgesOf(int)}, {@link #removeEdgesInOf(int)} and {@link #removeEdgesOutOf(int)}. To check if a graph is
 * directed or not, use the {@link #getCapabilities()} method.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Each vertex in the graph is identified by a unique non negative int ID. The set of vertices in the graph is always
 * {@code (0,1,2, ...,verticesNum-1)}. To maintain this, the graph implementation may rename existing vertices when the
 * user remove a vertex, see {@link #getVerticesIDStrategy()}. Similar to vertices, each edge in the graph is identified
 * by a unique non negative int ID. In contrast to the vertices IDs, it's not specified how the graph implementation
 * assign new IDs to added edges, or if it rename some of them when the user remove an edge, see
 * {@link #getEdgesIDStrategy()}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The number of vertices, \(|V|\), is usually denoted as \(n\) in algorithms time and space complexities. And
 * similarly, the number of edges, \(|E|\), is usually denoted as \(m\).
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * // Create a directed graph with three vertices and edges between them
 * Graph g = GraphBuilder.newDirected().build();
 * int v1 = g.addVertex();
 * int v2 = g.addVertex();
 * int v3 = g.addVertex();
 * int e1 = g.addEdge(v1, v2);
 * int e2 = g.addEdge(v2, v3);
 * int e3 = g.addEdge(v1, v3);
 *
 * // Assign some weights to the edges
 * Weights.Double w = g.addEdgesWeights(&quot;weightsKey&quot;, double.class);
 * w.set(e1, 1.2);
 * w.set(e2, 3.1);
 * w.set(e3, 15.1);
 *
 * // Calculate the shortest paths from v1 to all other vertices
 * SSSP ssspAlgo = SSSP.newBuilder().build();
 * SSSP.Result ssspRes = ssspAlgo.computeShortestPaths(g, w, v1);
 *
 * // Print the shortest path from v1 to v3
 * assert ssspRes.distance(v3) == 4.3;
 * assert ssspRes.getPath(v3).equals(IntList.of(e1, e2));
 * System.out.println(&quot;Distance from v1 to v3 is: &quot; + ssspRes.distance(v3));
 * System.out.println(&quot;The shortest path from v1 to v3 is:&quot;);
 * for (IntIterator it = ssspRes.getPath(v3).iterator(); it.hasNext();) {
