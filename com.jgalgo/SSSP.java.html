/**
 * Single Source Shortest Path algorithm.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Given a graph \(G=(V,E)\), and a weight function \(w:E \rightarrow R\), one might ask what is the shortest path from
 * a &lt;i&gt;source&lt;/i&gt; vertex to all other vertices in \(V\), where the 'shortest' is defined by comparing the sum of edges
 * weights of each path. A Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) is able to compute these shortest paths from a source to
 * any other vertex, along with the distances, which are the shortest paths lengths (weights).
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The most basic SSSP algorithms work on graphs with non negative weights, and they are the most efficient, such as
 * {@link SSSPDijkstra}. Negative weights are supported by some implementations of SSSP, and the 'shortest path' is well
 * defined as long as there are no negative cycle in the graph as a path can loop in the cycle and achieve arbitrary
 * small 'length'.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A special case of the SSSP problem is on directed graphs that does not contain any cycles, and it could be solved in
 * linear time for any weights types using {@link SSSPDag}. Another special case arise when the weight function assign
 * \(1\) to any edges, and the shortest paths could be computed again in linear time using {@link SSSPCardinality}.
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * // Create a directed graph with three vertices and edges between them
 * Graph g = Graph.newBuilderDirected().build();
 * int v1 = g.addVertex();
 * int v2 = g.addVertex();
 * int v3 = g.addVertex();
 * int e1 = g.addEdge(v1, v2);
 * int e2 = g.addEdge(v2, v3);
 * int e3 = g.addEdge(v1, v3);
 *
 * // Assign some weights to the edges
 * Weights.Double w = g.addEdgesWeights(&quot;weightsKey&quot;, double.class);
 * w.set(e1, 1.2);
 * w.set(e2, 3.1);
 * w.set(e3, 15.1);
 *
 * // Calculate the shortest paths from v1 to all other vertices
 * SSSP ssspAlgo = SSSP.newBuilder().build();
 * SSSP.Result ssspRes = ssspAlgo.computeShortestPaths(g, w, v1);
 *
 * // Print the shortest path from v1 to v3
 * assert ssspRes.distance(v3) == 4.3;
 * assert ssspRes.getPath(v3).equals(IntList.of(e1, e2));
 * System.out.println(&quot;Distance from v1 to v3 is: &quot; + ssspRes.distance(v3));
 * System.out.println(&quot;The shortest path from v1 to v3 is:&quot;);
 * for (IntIterator it = ssspRes.getPath(v3).iterator(); it.hasNext();) {
 * 	int e = it.nextInt();
 * 	int u = g.edgeSource(e), v = g.edgeTarget(e);
 * 	System.out.println(&quot; &quot; + e + &quot;(&quot; + u + &quot;, &quot; + v + &quot;)&quot;);
 * }
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
