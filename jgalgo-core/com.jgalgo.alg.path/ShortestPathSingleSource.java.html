/**
 * Single Source Shortest Path algorithm.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Given a graph \(G=(V,E)\), and a weight function \(w:E \rightarrow R\), one might ask what is the shortest path from
 * a &lt;i&gt;source&lt;/i&gt; vertex to all other vertices in \(V\), where the 'shortest' is defined by comparing the sum of edges
 * weights of each path. A Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) is able to compute these shortest paths from a source to
 * any other vertex, along with the distances, which are the shortest paths lengths (weights).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The most basic single source shortest path (SSSP) algorithms work on graphs with non negative weights, and they are
 * the most efficient, such as Dijkstra algorithm. Negative weights are supported by some implementations of SSSP, and
 * the 'shortest path' is well defined as long as there are no negative cycle in the graph as a path can loop in the
 * cycle and achieve arbitrary small 'length'. When the weights are allowed be negative, algorithms will either find the
 * shortest path to any other vertex, or will find a negative cycle, see {@link NegativeCycleException}. Note that if a
 * negative cycle exists, but it is not reachable from the source, the algorithm may or may not find it, depending on
 * the implementation. To get an algorithm instance that support negative weights, use
 * {@link ShortestPathSingleSource.Builder#setNegativeWeights(boolean)}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A special case of the SSSP problem is on directed graphs that does not contain any cycles, and it could be solved in
 * linear time for any weights types by calculating the topological order of the vertices (see
 * {@link ShortestPathSingleSource.Builder#setDag(boolean)}). Another special case arise when the weight function assign
 * \(1\) to any edges, and the shortest paths could be computed again in linear time using a BFS (see
 * {@link ShortestPathSingleSource.Builder#setCardinality(boolean)}).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Use {@link #newInstance()} to get a default implementation of this interface. A builder obtained via
 * {@link #builder()} may support different options to obtain different implementations.
 *
