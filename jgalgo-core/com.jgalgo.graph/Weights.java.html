/**
 * Weights of graph vertices or edges.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A weights object associated with the edges (vertices) of a graph support getting and setting a weight value for each
 * edge (vertex). Such weights are useful for various algorithms such as {@link ShortestPathSingleSource} or
 * {@link MatchingAlgo} to assigned the &lt;i&gt;cost&lt;/i&gt; of edges. Another example is boolean weights used to represent the
 * partition of vertices in {@linkplain BipartiteGraphs bipartite graphs}, which is used by algorithms such as
 * Hopcroft-Karp algorithm for cardinality maximum matching.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An exiting graph expose two methods to add new type of weights associated with its vertices or edges:
 * {@link Graph#addVerticesWeights(String, Class)} and {@link Graph#addEdgesWeights(String, Class)}. When a new weights
 * is added to the edges (vertices) of a graph, it is added to ALL edges (vertices) of the graph. Weights of primitive
 * types can be created by passing a primitive class to these methods, for example this snippet demonstrate how a
 * {@code double} weights type can be added to a graph, and then passed to {@link ShortestPathSingleSource} algorithm:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * // Create an undirected graph with three vertices and edges between them
 * Graph&lt;String, Integer&gt; g = Graph.newUndirected();
 * g.addVertex(&quot;Berlin&quot;);
 * g.addVertex(&quot;Leipzig&quot;);
 * g.addVertex(&quot;Dresden&quot;);
 * g.addEdge(&quot;Berlin&quot;, &quot;Leipzig&quot;, 9);
 * g.addEdge(&quot;Berlin&quot;, &quot;Dresden&quot;, 13);
 * g.addEdge(&quot;Dresden&quot;, &quot;Leipzig&quot;, 14);
 *
 * // Assign some weights to the edges
 * WeightsDouble&lt;Integer&gt; w = g.addEdgesWeights(&quot;distance-km&quot;, double.class);
 * w.set(9, 191.1);
 * w.set(13, 193.3);
 * w.set(14, 121.3);
 *
 * // Calculate the shortest paths from Berlin to all other cities
 * ShortestPathSingleSource ssspAlgo = ShortestPathSingleSource.newInstance();
 * ShortestPathSingleSource.Result&lt;String, Integer&gt; ssspRes = ssspAlgo.computeShortestPaths(g, w, &quot;Berlin&quot;);
 *
 * // Print the shortest path from Berlin to Leipzig
 * System.out.println(&quot;Distance from Berlin to Leipzig is: &quot; + ssspRes.distance(&quot;Leipzig&quot;));
 * System.out.println(&quot;The shortest path from Berlin to Leipzig is:&quot;);
 * for (Integer e : ssspRes.getPath(&quot;Leipzig&quot;).edges()) {
 * 	String u = g.edgeSource(e), v = g.edgeTarget(e);
 * 	System.out.println(&quot; &quot; + e + &quot;(&quot; + u + &quot;, &quot; + v + &quot;)&quot;);
 * }
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A default weight can be provided in the time of the weights container. The default weight will be returned for every
 * edge (vertex) that was not explicitly set another value.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There are type specific weights interfaces for both primitives and objects, such as {@link WeightsDouble},
 * {@link WeightsInt}, {@link WeightsObj}, etc. The super interface {@link Weights} allow to get and set weights as
 * objects, and should not be used when the type of the weights is known. The sub interfaces expose methods to get and
 * set weights as the specific type, for example {@link WeightsInt#get(Object)}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If the weights container is associated with the edges of an index graph, and the graph implementation chooses to
 * perform some swaps and renames to the edges, the weights container will update automatically (see
 * {@link IndexGraph#addEdgeRemoveListener(IndexRemoveListener)}).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The {@link Weights} interface can be used for edges or vertices, depending on how it was created. In this
 * documentation we use the term 'element' to refer to either an edge or a vertex.
