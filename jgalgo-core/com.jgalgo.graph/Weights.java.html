/**
 * Weights of graph vertices or edges.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A weights object associated with the edges (vertices) of a graph support getting and setting a weight value for each
 * edge (vertex). Such weights are useful for various algorithms such as {@link ShortestPathSingleSource} or
 * {@link MatchingAlgo} to assigned the &lt;i&gt;cost&lt;/i&gt; of edges. Another example is boolean weights used to represent the
 * partition of vertices in bipartite graphs, which is used by algorithms such as Hopcroft-Karp algorithm for
 * cardinality maximum matching in bipartite graphs.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An exiting graph expose two methods to add new type of weights associated with its vertices or edges:
 * {@link Graph#addVerticesWeights(String, Class)} and {@link Graph#addEdgesWeights(String, Class)}. Weights of
 * primitive types can be created by passing a primitive class to these methods, for example this snippet demonstrate
 * how a {@code double} weights type can be added to a graph, and then passed to {@link ShortestPathSingleSource}
 * algorithm:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * // Create a directed graph with three vertices and edges between them
 * Graph g = Graph.newDirected();
 * int v1 = g.addVertex();
 * int v2 = g.addVertex();
 * int v3 = g.addVertex();
 * int e1 = g.addEdge(v1, v2);
 * int e2 = g.addEdge(v2, v3);
 * int e3 = g.addEdge(v1, v3);
 *
 * // Assign some weights to the edges
 * WeightsDouble w = g.addEdgesWeights(&quot;weightsKey&quot;, double.class);
 * w.set(e1, 1.2);
 * w.set(e2, 3.1);
 * w.set(e3, 15.1);
 *
 * // Calculate the shortest paths from v1 to all other vertices
 * ShortestPathSingleSource ssspAlgo = ShortestPathSingleSource.newInstance();
 * ShortestPathSingleSource.Result ssspRes = ssspAlgo.computeShortestPaths(g, w, v1);
 *
 * // Print the shortest path from v1 to v3
 * assert ssspRes.distance(v3) == 4.3;
 * assert ssspRes.getPath(v3).equals(IntList.of(e1, e2));
 * System.out.println(&quot;Distance from v1 to v3 is: &quot; + ssspRes.distance(v3));
 * System.out.println(&quot;The shortest path from v1 to v3 is:&quot;);
 * for (int e : ssspRes.getPath(v3)) {
 * 	int u = g.edgeSource(e), v = g.edgeTarget(e);
 * 	System.out.println(&quot; &quot; + e + &quot;(&quot; + u + &quot;, &quot; + v + &quot;)&quot;);
 * }
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A default weight can be provided in the time of the weights container. The default weight will be returned for every
 * edge (vertex) that was not explicitly set another value.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If the weights container is associated with the edges of an index graph, and the graph implementation chooses to
 * perform some swaps and renames to the edges, the weights container will update automatically (see
 * {@link IndexGraph#addEdgeSwapListener(IndexSwapListener)}).
