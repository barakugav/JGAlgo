/**
 * A builder for {@linkplain Graph graphs}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The builder is used to construct &lt;b&gt;non-empty&lt;/b&gt; graphs. Differing from {@link GraphFactory} which create new empty
 * graphs, the builder is used to add vertices and edges before actually creating the graph. This capability is required
 * to create immutable graphs, but can also be used to build mutable graph and may gain a performance boost compared to
 * creating an empty graph and adding the same vertices and edges.
