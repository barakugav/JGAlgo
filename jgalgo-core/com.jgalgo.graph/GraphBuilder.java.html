/**
 * A builder for {@linkplain Graph graphs}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The builder is used to construct &lt;b&gt;non-empty&lt;/b&gt; graphs. Differing from {@link GraphFactory} which create new empty
 * graphs, the builder is used to add vertices and edges before actually creating the graph. This capability is required
 * to create immutable graphs, but can also be used to build mutable graph and may gain a performance boost compared to
 * creating an empty graph and adding the same vertices and edges.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * To create a new builder, use one of the static methods {@link #undirected()}, {@link #directed()} or
 * {@link #newInstance(boolean)}. For more options, create a new {@link GraphFactory} and use
 * {@link GraphFactory#newBuilder()}, or use {@link GraphFactory#newBuilderCopyOf(Graph)} to create a builder
 * initialized with an existing graph vertices and edges.
 *
