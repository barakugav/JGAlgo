/**
 * A graph whose vertices and edges identifiers are indices.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The {@link Graph} interface provide addition, removal and querying of vertices and edges, all using some hashable
 * identifiers. These identifiers are fixed, and once a vertex or edge is assigned an ID, it will not change during the
 * graph lifetime. On the other hand, an &lt;i&gt;Index&lt;/i&gt; graph is a {@link IntGraph} object in which the vertices and edges
 * identifiers of the graph are &lt;b&gt;always&lt;/b&gt; {@code (0,1,2, ...,verticesNum-1)} and {@code (0,1,2, ...,edgesNum-1)}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The index graph invariants allow for a great performance boost, as a simple array or bitmap can be used to associate
 * a value/weight/flag with each vertex/edge. But it does come with a cost: to maintain the invariants, implementations
 * may need to rename existing vertices or edges during the graph lifetime. These renames can be subscribed-to using
 * {@link #addVertexRemoveListener(IndexRemoveListener)} and {@link #addEdgeRemoveListener(IndexRemoveListener)}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An index graph may be obtained as a view from a regular {@link Graph} using {@link Graph#indexGraph()}, or it can be
 * created on its own using {@link IndexGraphFactory}. In cases where no removal of vertices or edges is required, and
 * there is no need to use pre-defined IDs, there is no drawback of using the {@link IndexGraph} as a regular
 * {@link IntGraph}, as it will expose an identical functionality while providing better performance.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If an {@link IndexGraph} is obtained from a regular {@link Graph} (or {@link IntGraph}) using
 * {@link Graph#indexGraph()}, the {@link IndexGraph} should not be modified directly. Vertices/edges/weights should be
 * added/removed only via the original fixed identifiers graph.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * All graph algorithms implementations should operation on Index graphs only, for best performance. If a regular
 * {@link Graph} is provided to an algorithm, the Index graph should be retrieved using {@link Graph#indexGraph()}, the
 * algorithm expensive logic should operate on the returned Index graph and finally the result should be transformed
 * back to the regular graph IDs. The mapping from a regular graph IDs to indices and vice versa is provided by
 * {@link IndexIdMap}, which can be accessed using {@link Graph#indexGraphVerticesMap()} and
 * {@link Graph#indexGraphEdgesMap()}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * To create a new empty index graph, use {@link #newUndirected()} or {@link #newDirected()}. The returned graph will
 * use the default implementation. For more control over the graph details, see {@link IndexGraphFactory}. To construct
 * an immutable index graph, use {@link IndexGraphBuilder}.
