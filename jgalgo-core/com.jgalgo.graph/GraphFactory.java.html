/**
 * A factory for {@link Graph} objects.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The factory can be used to create new empty graphs, with different options and capabilities. Few methods are
 * available to optimize the graph implementation choice. The factory can also be used to create a copy of an existing
 * graphs, with the same vertices and edges, with/without copying the vertices/edges weights.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Both the graph factory and {@link GraphBuilder} are used to create new graphs. The difference is that vertices and
 * edges can be added to the builder, which is then used to construct non empty graphs, while the factory is only used
 * to choose a graph implementation and create an empty graph.
 *
