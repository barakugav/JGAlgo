/**
 * A discrete graph with vertices and edges.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A graph consist of a finite set of vertices \(V\) and edges \(E\). Vertices are some abstract entities, and edges are
 * connections between the vertices, for example vertices can be cities and edges could be the roads between them, or
 * vertices can be people the edges are the relation of &quot;friends&quot;. Edges could be directed or undirected. Weights may be
 * assigned to vertices or edges, for example the length of a road might be a weight of an edge. Than, questions such as
 * &quot;what is the shortest path between two cities?&quot; might be answered using graph algorithms.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Each edge \(e=(u, v)\) in the graph has a &lt;i&gt;source&lt;/i&gt; vertex, \(u\), and a &lt;i&gt;target&lt;/i&gt; vertex, \(v\). In
 * undirected graphs the 'source' and 'target' can be switched, as the edge is not directed, and we treat the source and
 * target as interchangeable &lt;i&gt;end points&lt;/i&gt;. If an edge \((u,v)\) exist in the graph, we say the vertices \(u\) and
 * \(v\) and &lt;i&gt;neighbors&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;adjacent&lt;/i&gt;. The edges are usually stored in some list for each vertex, allowing
 * efficient iteration of its edges. The &lt;i&gt;degree&lt;/i&gt; of a vertex is the number of its edges. In directed graph, we
 * have both &lt;i&gt;in-degree&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;out-degree&lt;/i&gt;, which are the number of edges going in and out the vertex,
 * respectively.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Vertices can be added or removed. When a vertex \(v\) is removed, all the edges with \(v\) as one of their end points
 * are removed as well. Edges can be added as connection to existing vertices, or removed.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A directed graph and an undirected graph are both implemented by this interface. In a directed graph, the edges are
 * &lt;i&gt;directed&lt;/i&gt;, namely an edge \(e=(u, v)\) will be contained in {@code outEdges(u)} and in {@code inEdges(v)} and
 * will not be contained in {@code outEdges(v)} and {@code inEdges(u)}. In an undirected graph, the edges are
 * undirected, namely an edge \(e=\{u, v\}\) will be contained in {@code outEdges(u)}, {@code inEdges(v)},
 * {@code outEdges(v)} and in {@code inEdges(u)}. Also {@link #removeEdgesOf(Object)}, {@link #removeInEdgesOf(Object)}
 * and {@link #removeOutEdgesOf(Object)} are equivalent for the same vertex in an undirected graph. To check if a graph
 * is directed or not, use the {@link #isDirected()} method.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Each vertex and edge in the graph is identified by a unique non null hashable object. The existing vertices and edges
 * of the graph can be retrieved using {@link #vertices()} and {@link #edges()}. Vertices and edges may be added by
 * {@link #addVertex(Object)} and {@link #addEdge(Object, Object, Object)}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Weights may be assigned to the graph vertices and/or edges. A &lt;i&gt;weight&lt;/i&gt; is some value such as any primitive (for
 * example {@code double}, {@code int} or {@code boolean} flag) or an Object. Multiple different weights can be added to
 * the vertices and/or edges, each is identified by some string key. When a new weights type is added to a graph, it is
 * added to &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the vertices/edges, with either user provided default weight value, or {@code null} ({@code 0} in
 * case the weight type is primitive). The weights are accessed via the {@link Weights} container, which can be used to
 * get or set a vertex/edge weight, and can be passed to algorithms as a {@link WeightFunction} for example. See
 * {@link #addVerticesWeights(String, Class)} and {@link #addEdgesWeights(String, Class)}, or {@link Weights} for the
 * full weights documentation.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Each graph expose an &lt;i&gt;Index&lt;/i&gt; view on itself via the {@link #indexGraph()} method. The returned
 * {@link IndexGraph} is a graph in which the identifiers of the vertices are always {@code (0,1,2, ...,verticesNum-1)},
 * and the identifiers of the edges are always {@code (0,1,2, ...,edgesNum-1)}. To maintain this, the index graph
 * implementation may rename existing vertices or edges along the graph lifetime. This rename behavior is less user
 * friendly, but allow for high performance boost as no hash tables are needed, a simple array or bitmap can be used to
 * map each vertex/edge to a value/weight/flag. See {@link IndexGraph} for more information. The {@link IndexGraph}
 * should not be used in scenarios where performance does not matter.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The number of vertices and edges can be read via {@code g.vertices().size()} and {@code g.edges().size()}. The out or
 * in degree of a vertex is exposed by {@code g.outEdges(vertex).size()} and {@code g.inEdges(vertex).size()}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The number of vertices, \(|V|\), is usually denoted as \(n\) in algorithms time and space complexities, and
 * similarly, the number of edges, \(|E|\), is usually denoted as \(m\).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * To create a new empty graph, use {@link #newUndirected()} or {@link #newDirected()}. The returned graph will use the
 * default implementation. For more control over the graph details, see {@link GraphFactory}. To construct an immutable
 * graph, use {@link GraphBuilder}.
