/**
 * Weights of {@linkplain IntGraph int graph} vertices or edges.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This interface is a specification of {@link Weights} for {@link IntGraph}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A weights object associated with the edges (vertices) of a graph support getting and setting a weight value for each
 * edge (vertex). Such weights are useful for various algorithms such as {@link ShortestPathSingleSource} or
 * {@link MatchingAlgo} to assigned the &lt;i&gt;cost&lt;/i&gt; of edges. Another example is boolean weights used to represent the
 * partition of vertices in {@linkplain BipartiteGraphs bipartite graphs}, which is used by algorithms such as
 * Hopcroft-Karp algorithm for cardinality maximum matching.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An exiting graph expose two methods to add new type of weights associated with its vertices or edges:
 * {@link IntGraph#addVerticesWeights(String, Class)} and {@link IntGraph#addEdgesWeights(String, Class)}. Weights of
 * primitive types can be created by passing a primitive class to these methods, for example this snippet demonstrate
 * how a {@code double} weights type can be added to a graph, and then passed to {@link ShortestPathSingleSource}
 * algorithm:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * // Create a directed graph with three vertices and edges between them
 * IntGraph g = IntGraph.newDirected();
 * int v1 = g.addVertex();
 * int v2 = g.addVertex();
 * int v3 = g.addVertex();
 * int e1 = g.addEdge(v1, v2);
 * int e2 = g.addEdge(v2, v3);
 * int e3 = g.addEdge(v1, v3);
 *
 * // Assign some weights to the edges
 * IWeightsDouble weights = g.addEdgesWeights(&quot;weightsKey&quot;, double.class);
 * weights.set(e1, 1.2);
 * weights.set(e2, 3.1);
 * weights.set(e3, 15.1);
 * IWeightFunction weightFunc = weights;
 *
 * // Calculate the shortest paths from v1 to all other vertices
 * ShortestPathSingleSource ssspAlgo = ShortestPathSingleSource.newInstance();
 * ShortestPathSingleSource.Result ssspRes = ssspAlgo.computeShortestPaths(g, weightFunc, v1);
 *
 * // Print the shortest path from v1 to v3
 * assert ssspRes.distance(v3) == 4.3;
 * assert ssspRes.getPath(v3).edges().equals(IntList.of(e1, e2));
 * System.out.println(&quot;Distance from v1 to v3 is: &quot; + ssspRes.distance(v3));
 * System.out.println(&quot;The shortest path from v1 to v3 is:&quot;);
 * for (int e : ssspRes.getPath(v3).edges()) {
 * 	int u = g.edgeSource(e), v = g.edgeTarget(e);
 * 	System.out.println(&quot; &quot; + e + &quot;(&quot; + u + &quot;, &quot; + v + &quot;)&quot;);
 * }
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A default weight can be provided in the time of the weights container. The default weight will be returned for every
 * edge (vertex) that was not explicitly set another value.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There are type specific weights interfaces for both primitives and objects, such as {@link IWeightsDouble},
 * {@link IWeightsInt}, {@link IWeightsObj}, etc. The super interface {@link IWeights} allow to get and set weights as
 * objects, and should not be used when the type of the weights is known. The sub interfaces expose methods to get and
 * set weights as the specific type, for example {@link IWeightsInt#get(int)}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If the weights container is associated with the edges of an index graph, and the graph implementation chooses to
 * perform some swaps and renames to the edges, the weights container will update automatically (see
 * {@link IndexGraph#addEdgeRemoveListener(IndexRemoveListener)}).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The {@link IWeights} interface can be used for edges or vertices, depending on how it was created. In this
 * documentation we use the term 'element' to refer to either an edge or a vertex.
