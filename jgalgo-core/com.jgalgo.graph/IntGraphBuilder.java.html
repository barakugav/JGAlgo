/**
 * A builder for {@linkplain IntGraph int graphs}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The builder is used to construct &lt;b&gt;non-empty&lt;/b&gt; int graphs. Differing from {@link IntGraphFactory} which create new
 * empty graphs, the builder is used to add vertices and edges before actually creating the graph. This capability is
 * required to create immutable graphs, but can also be used to build mutable graph and may gain a performance boost
 * compared to creating an empty graph and adding the same vertices and edges.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * To create a new builder, use one of the static methods {@link #undirected()}, {@link #directed()} or
 * {@link #newInstance(boolean)}. For more options, create a new {@link IntGraphFactory} and use
 * {@link IntGraphFactory#newBuilder()}, or use {@link IntGraphFactory#newBuilderCopyOf(Graph)} to create a builder
 * initialized with an existing graph vertices and edges.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This interface is a specific version of {@link GraphBuilder} for {@link IntGraph}.
 *
 * @see    IntGraphBuilder#undirected()
