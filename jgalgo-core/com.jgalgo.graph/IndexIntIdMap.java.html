/**
 * A mapping between {@link IntGraph} IDs to {@link IndexGraph} indices.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This interface is a specification of {@link IndexIdMap} for {@link IntGraph}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A regular graph contains vertices and edges which are identified by a fixed {@code int} IDs. An {@link IndexGraph}
 * view is provided by the {@link IntGraph#indexGraph()} method, which is a graph in which all methods are accessed with
 * &lt;b&gt;indices&lt;/b&gt; rather than fixed IDs. This interface maps between the indices and the fixed IDs of the graph vertices
 * or edges.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Note that the mapping may change during the graph lifetime, as vertices and edges are added and removed from the
 * graph, and a regular graph IDs are fixed, while a index graph indices are always {@code (0,1,2, ...,verticesNum-1)}
 * and {@code (0,1,2, ...,edgesNum-1)}. The mapping object will be updated automatically in such cases.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The mapping interface is used for both vertices and edges, and we use a unify term &lt;i&gt;element&lt;/i&gt; in the
 * documentation to describe both of them. If the mapping was obtained by {@link IntGraph#indexGraphVerticesMap()} it
 * will map between vertices IDs and indices, and if it was obtained by {@link IntGraph#indexGraphEdgesMap()} it will
 * map between edges IDs and indices.
