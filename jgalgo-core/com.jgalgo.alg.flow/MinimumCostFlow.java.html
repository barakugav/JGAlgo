/**
 * Compute the minimum-cost (max) flow in a flow network.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There are a few variations of the minimum-cost flow problem: (1) given source(s) and sink(s) terminal vertices, and
 * the objecting is to find the flow with the lowest cost out of all maximum flows. (2) given per-vertex finite supply,
 * and the objective is to find a minimum-cost flow satisfying the supply, namely that for each vertex the sum of flow
 * units going out of the vertex minus the sum of flow units going into it is equal to its supply.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * In addition to these variants, a lower bound for each edge flow can be specified, similar to the capacities which can
 * be viewed as upper bounds.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Use {@link #newInstance()} to get a default implementation of this interface. A builder obtained via
 * {@link #builder()} may support different options to obtain different implementations.
