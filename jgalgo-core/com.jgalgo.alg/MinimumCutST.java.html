/**
 * Minimum Cut algorithm with terminal vertices (source-sink, S-T).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Given a graph \(G=(V,E)\), a cut is a partition of \(V\) into two sets \(C, \bar{C} = V \setminus C\). Given a weight
 * function, the weight of a cut \((C,\bar{C})\) is the weight sum of all edges \((u,v)\) such that \(u\) is in \(C\)
 * and \(v\) is in \(\bar{C}\). There are two variants of the problem to find a minimum weight cut: (1) With terminal
 * vertices, and (2) without terminal vertices. In the variant with terminal vertices, we are given two special vertices
 * {@code source (S)} and {@code sink (T)} and we need to find the minimum cut \((C,\bar{C})\) such that the
 * {@code source} is in \(C\) and the {@code sink} is in \(\bar{C}\). In the variant without terminal vertices we need
 * to find the global cut, and \(C,\bar{C}\) simply must not be empty.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Algorithms implementing this interface compute the minimum cut given two terminal vertices, {@code source (S)} and
 * {@code sink (T)}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Use {@link #newInstance()} to get a default implementation of this interface. A builder obtained via
 * {@link #newBuilder()} may support different options to obtain different implementations.
