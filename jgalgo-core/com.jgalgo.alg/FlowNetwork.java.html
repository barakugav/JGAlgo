/**
 * Flow on graph edges, with capacities and flows values.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A flow network on graph edges is defined as two functions: the capacity function \(C:E \rightarrow R\) and flow
 * function \(F:E \rightarrow R\). The capacity function define how many units of flow an edge can transfer from its
 * source to its target. The flow function define the number of units of flow that are currently transferred along each
 * edge. The capacity of any edge must be non negative, and the edge's flow must be smaller or equal to its capacity.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Problems formulated using flow networks involve a source and a sink vertices. The source is a vertex from which the
 * flow is originated, and every flow going along its edges must reach the sink vertex using the edges of the graphs
 * while not violating the capacities of the network. For each vertex except the source and sink the sum of flow units
 * going along {@link Graph#inEdges(Object)} must be equal to the sum of flow units going along
 * {@link Graph#outEdges(Object)}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A flow is most intuitively defined on directed graphs, as the flow on an edge is transferred from one vertex to
 * another in some direction, but we can define and solve flow problem on undirected graphs as well. Technically, the
 * flows values returned by {@link #getFlow(Object)} can either be positive or negative for undirected edges, with
 * values absolutely smaller than the capacity of the edge. A positive flow \(+f\) value assigned to edge {@code e}
 * means a flow directed from {@code edgeSource(e)} to {@code edgeTarget(e)} with \(f\) units of flow. A negative flow
 * \(-f\) value assigned to edge {@code e} means a flow directed from {@code edgeTarget(e)} to {@code edgeSource(e)}
 * (opposite direction) with \(|-f|\) units of flow (see {@link #getFlow(Object)}).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Some algorithm might be more efficient when the capacities and flows are integers. The interface
 * {@link FlowNetworkInt} represent a network in which the capacities and flows are integers. In addition, both
 * interfaces {@link IFlowNetwork} and {@link IFlowNetworkInt} are specific versions of {@link FlowNetwork} and
 * {@link FlowNetworkInt} for {@link IntGraph}.
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * Graph&lt;String, Integer&gt; g = ...;
 * FlowNetwork&lt;String, Integer&gt; net = FlowNetwork.createAsEdgeWeight(g);
 * for (Integer e : g.edges())
 *  f.setCapacity(e, 1);
 *
 * String sourceVertex = ...;
 * String targetVertex = ...;
 * MaximumFlow maxFlowAlg = MaximumFlow.newInstance();
 *
 * double totalFlow = maxFlowAlg.computeMaximumFlow(g, net, sourceVertex, targetVertex);

 * 	double capacity = net.getCapacity(e);
 * 	double flow = net.getFlow(e);
 * 	System.out.println(&quot;flow on edge &quot; + e + &quot;: &quot; + flow + &quot;/&quot; + capacity);
