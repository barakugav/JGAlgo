/**
 * Minimum Edge-Cut algorithm with terminal vertices (source-sink, S-T).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Given a graph \(G=(V,E)\), an edge cut is a partition of \(V\) into two sets \(C, \bar{C} = V \setminus C\). Given an
 * edge weight function, the weight of an edge-cut \((C,\bar{C})\) is the weight sum of all edges \((u,v)\) such that
 * \(u\) is in \(C\) and \(v\) is in \(\bar{C}\). There are two variants of the problem to find a minimum weight
 * edge-cut: (1) With terminal vertices, and (2) without terminal vertices. In the variant with terminal vertices, we
 * are given two special vertices {@code source (S)} and {@code sink (T)} and we need to find the minimum edge-cut
 * \((C,\bar{C})\) such that the {@code source} is in \(C\) and the {@code sink} is in \(\bar{C}\). In the variant
 * without terminal vertices (also called 'global edge-cut') we need to find the minimal cut among all possible cuts,
 * and \(C,\bar{C}\) simply must not be empty.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Algorithms implementing this interface compute the minimum edge-cut given two terminal vertices, {@code source (S)}
 * and {@code sink (T)}. To enumerate &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; minimum edge-cuts between two terminal vertices, use
 * {@link MinimumEdgeCutAllST}. For the global variant (without terminal vertices), see {@link MinimumEdgeCutGlobal}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The cardinality (unweighted) minimum edge-cut between two vertices is equal to the (local) edge connectivity of these
 * two vertices. If the graph is directed, the edge connectivity between \(u\) and \(v\) is the minimum of the minimum
 * edge-cut between \(u\) and \(v\) and the minimum edge-cut between \(v\) and \(u\).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Use {@link #newInstance()} to get a default implementation of this interface. A builder obtained via
 * {@link #newBuilder()} may support different options to obtain different implementations.
