/**
 * Tester that check whether two graphs are isomorphic.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Given two graphs, an isomorphism is a mapping function that maps the first graph vertices to the second graph
 * vertices, while preserving the structure of the graph. There are few variants of the problem, such as 'full' or 'sub
 * graph' isomorphism, see {@link IsomorphismType}. A full isomorphism maps all vertices and edges, while subgraph
 * isomorphism maps all vertices and edges of a single graph to a subset of the vertices and edges of the other graph.
 * All the methods of this interface accept two graphs and check if there is an isomorphism between them. In case the
 * checked isomorphism is one of the sub graph types, the first graph {@code g1} is the smaller graph, and the second
 * graph {@code g2} is the bigger graph, namely the methods search for a mapping from {@code g1} to a sub graph of
 * {@code g2}. Further details are given in the documentation of each method.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The full isomorphism problem which asks whether two graphs are isomorphic is one of few standard problems in
 * computational complexity theory belonging to NP, but not known to belong to either of its well-known subsets: P and
 * NP-complete. The sub graph types are NP-complete.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Use {@link #newInstance()} to get a default implementation of this interface.
