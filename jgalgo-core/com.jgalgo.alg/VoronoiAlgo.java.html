/**
 * Voronoi cells algorithm.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Given a graph \(G=(V,E)\) and a set of sites \(S \subseteq V\), the Voronoi cells of \(S\) are the sets of vertices
 * that are closer to a site than to any other site. The Voronoi cells are a partition of the graph vertices, namely
 * each vertex is assigned to exactly one site.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The distances and paths are directed from the sites to the vertices. If the other direction is needed, consider
 * passing a reversed view of the original graph by using {@link Graph#reverseView()}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If there are some vertices that are unreachable from any sites, the partition will contain an addition block with
 * index {@code siteNumber+1} that contains all these vertices.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Use {@link #newInstance()} to get a default implementation of this interface.
