/**
 * Generates a random bipartite graph using the \(G(n_1,n_2,p)\) model in which every edge exists with probability
 * \(p\).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The \(G(n_1,n_2,p)\) model generates a bipartite graph by connecting each pair of a left vertex and a right vertex
 * with probability \(p\). Each edge is created with probability independent of the others. The generator accept two
 * sets of vertices, the left and right vertices sets of the bipartite graph, and the probability \(p\).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Both undirected and directed graphs can be generated. If the graph is directed, there are three options for the
 * considered (each generated independently with probability \(p\)) edges between each pair of left and right vertices:
 * two edges in both directions, one edge from the left vertex to the right vertex, or one edge from the right vertex to
 * the left vertex. See {@link #directedAll()}, {@link #directedLeftToRight()} and {@link #directedRightToLeft()} for
 * more details.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The generated graph(s) will have vertex {@linkplain WeightsBool boolean weights} with key
 * {@link BipartiteGraphs#VertexBiPartitionWeightKey} which is the partition of the vertices into the left and right set
 * of vertices. The weight is set to {@code true} for vertices in the left set, and {@code false} for vertices in the
 * right set. The {@link VertexBiPartition} can be created later using
 * {@link BipartiteGraphs#getExistingPartition(Graph)}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * By default, the value of \(p\) is \(0.1\) and the graph is undirected. Self and parallel edges are never created.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * In the following example, a bipartite graph with four left vertices and six right vertices is generated. Each edge is
 * created with probability \(0.15\). The graph is directed from left to right, and the seed of the random number
 * generator is set to some fixed value for deterministic behavior.
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * Graph&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; g = new GnpBipartiteGraphGenerator&lt;&gt;(IntGraphFactory.directed())
 * 		.directedLeftToRight()
 * 		.vertices(4, 6)
 * 		.edgeProbability(0.15)
 * 		.seed(0x7d0c16fa09e05751L)
 * 		.generate();
 * } &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * For deterministic behavior, set the seed of the generator using {@link #seed(long)}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This generator is the bipartite version of {@link GnpGraphGenerator}.
