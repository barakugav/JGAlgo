/**
 * Generates a complete bipartite graph.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets \(U\) and \(V\) such that every
 * edge connects a vertex in \(U\) to one in \(V\). The two sets are usually called the left and right vertices. A
 * complete bipartite graph is a bipartite graph in which each pair of left and right vertices is connected by an edge.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Both undirected and directed graphs can be generated. If the graph is directed, there are three options for the
 * generated edges between each pair of left and right vertices: generate two edges in both directions, generate one
 * edge from the left vertex to the right vertex, or generate one edge from the right vertex to the left vertex. See
 * {@link #directedAll()}, {@link #directedLeftToRight()} and {@link #directedRightToLeft()} for more details.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The generated graph(s) will have vertex {@linkplain WeightsBool boolean weights} with key
 * {@link BipartiteGraphs#VertexBiPartitionWeightKey} which is the partition of the vertices into the left and right set
 * of vertices. The weight is set to {@code true} for vertices in the left set, and {@code false} for vertices in the
 * right set. The {@link VertexBiPartition} can be created later using
 * {@link BipartiteGraphs#getExistingPartition(Graph)}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * In the following example, a complete bipartite graph with four left and six right vertices is generated:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * Graph&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; g = new CompleteBipartiteGraphGenerator&lt;&gt;(IntGraphFactory.directed())
 * 		.directedAll()
 * 		.vertices(4, 6)
 * 		.edges(IdBuilderInt.defaultBuilder())
 * 		.generate();
 * } &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * By default, the generated graph(s) is undirected. Self and parallel edges are never created.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This generator is the bipartite version of {@link CompleteGraphGenerator}.
 *
 * @param  &lt;V&gt; the vertices type
 * @param  &lt;E&gt; the edges type
 * @see        BipartiteGraphs
