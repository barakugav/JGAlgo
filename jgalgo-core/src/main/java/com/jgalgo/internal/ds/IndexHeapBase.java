/**
 * A base interface for all index heap interfaces.
 *
 * <p>
 * Instead of using pointers to the nodes in the heap for queries and updates, we use indices in range \([0, size)\),
 * where the size is known in advance. This allows us to use arrays instead of pointers, which is more efficient in
 * terms of memory and cache locality. Sub interfaces of this interface are used to define the type of the key and the
 * comparator used to compare different elements (indices).
