/**
 * Generates the line graph given an existing graph.
 *
 * <p>
 * Given a graph \(G=(V,E)\), the line graph \(L=(E,H)\) is the graph whose vertices are the edges of \(G\) and a pair
 * of such two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding edges in the original graph share an endpoint. For
 * directed graphs, two vertices are connected if their corresponding edges form a path of size two in the original
 * graph. The line graph \(L\) is directed if and only if the original graph \(G\) is directed.
 *
 * <p>
 * The generate graph will not contains self edges, and no parallel edges. Specifically, if the original graph contains
 * two parallel edges, meaning their share two endpoints rather than one, the generated graph will contain only one edge
 * between their corresponding vertices.
 *
 * <p>
 * In the following example, the line graph of the original graph is generated. The vertices type of the original graph
 * is {@link URI}, and the edges type is {@link String}. The vertices type of the generated line graph is {@link String}
 * (the edges type of the original graph), and the edges type is {@link Integer}. The edges of the generated line graph
 * are generated using the default edge builder provided by {@link IdBuilderInt#defaultBuilder()}.
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * Graph<URI, String> origGraph = ...;
 * Graph<String, Integer> lineGraph = new LineGraphGenerator<String, Integer>()
