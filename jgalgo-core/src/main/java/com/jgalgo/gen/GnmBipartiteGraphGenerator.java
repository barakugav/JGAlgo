/**
 * Generates a uniformly random bipartite graph among all graphs with \(n\) vertices and \(m\) edges.
 *
 * <p>
 * A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets \(U\) and \(V\) such that every
 * edge connects a vertex in \(U\) to one in \(V\). The two sets are usually called the left and right vertices. The
 * generator uses the \(G(n_1,n_2,m)\) model to generate a uniformly random bipartite graph among all graphs with
 * \(n_1\) left vertices, \(n_2\) right vertices and \(m\) edges.
 *
 * <p>
 * Both undirected and directed graphs can be generated. If the graph is directed, there are three options for the
 * considered edges between each pair of left and right vertices: edges in both directions, edge(s) from the left vertex
 * to the right vertex, or edge(s) from the right vertex to the left vertex. If no parallel edges are generated
 * ({@link #parallelEdges(boolean)}) than at most a single edge is generated from the left to right vertex, and another
 * one from right to left. See {@link #directedAll()}, {@link #directedLeftToRight()} and {@link #directedRightToLeft()}
 * for more details.
 *
 * <p>
 * The generated graph(s) will have vertex {@linkplain WeightsBool boolean weights} with key
 * {@link BipartiteGraphs#VertexBiPartitionWeightKey} which is the partition of the vertices into the left and right set
 * of vertices. The weight is set to {@code true} for vertices in the left set, and {@code false} for vertices in the
 * right set. The {@link VertexBiPartition} can be created later using
 * {@link BipartiteGraphs#getExistingPartition(Graph)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, the generated graph(s) will be undirected without parallel edges. Self edges are never generated.
 *
 * <p>
 * For deterministic behavior, set the seed of the generator using {@link #seed(long)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This generator is the bipartite version of {@link GnmGraphGenerator}.
