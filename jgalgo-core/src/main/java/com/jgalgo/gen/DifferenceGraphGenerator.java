 * Generate a graph that contains the edges that exist in one graph but not in the other.
 *
 * <p>
 * Given two graphs with the same vertex set \(G_1=(V,E_1)\) and \(G_2=(V,E_2)\), the difference graph \(G=(V,E)\) is a
 * graph with the same vertex set that contains every edge that exists in \(E_1\) but not in \(E_2\). Saying one edge
 * from \(E_1\) is the same edge as another from \(E_2\) can be defined by the edge id or by the edge endpoints. See
 * {@link #edgeDifferenceById()} and {@link #edgeDifferenceByEndpoints()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, the edges are compared by their id. Use {@link #edgeDifferenceByEndpoints()} to compare edges by their
 * endpoints.
 *
 * <p>
 * Weights are not copied from the input graphs to the generated graph(s). In the future there might be an option to do
 * so.
