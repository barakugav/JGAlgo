/**
 * Graph generators used to generate (possibly random) graphs with different distributions and structures.
 *
 * <p>
 * Graph generators are essential for proper testing/benchmarking of algorithms. They can be used to generate with
 * different distributions and structures. A generator may be used to generate only trees, only bipartite graphs, dense
 * or sparse graphs, etc. It is not a trivial task to generate a graph with real world properties, and therefore
 * multiple generators exists, each with different properties.
