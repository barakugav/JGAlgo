/**
 * Generates a random graph using the R-MAT model.
 *
 * <p>
 * The R-MAT model generates a graph by recursively partitioning the adjacency matrix into four quadrants and assigning
 * edges to each quadrant with different probabilities \((a,b,c,d)\). The generator accept as an input how many edges to
 * generate, and it generate them one by one: each edge is assigned to a quadrant according to the probabilities
 * \((a,b,c,d)\), and then the quadrant is recursively partitioned until a single cell is reached. The cell is then
 * assigned the edge. The process is repeated until the required number of edges is generated. Except the vertices set
 * and the number of edges to generate, the model has four parameters: the probabilities \((a,b,c,d)\). The generated
 * graphs may be either directed or undirected, but parallel edges are never created.
 *
 * <p>
 * The probabilities \((a,b,c,d)\) must be in \([0,1]\) and sum to \(1\). If the graph is undirected, the probabilities
 * \(b\) and \(c\) must be equal. By default, the values of \((a,b,c,d)\) are \((0.57,0.21,0.17,0.05)\) for directed
 * graphs and \((0.57,0.19,0.19,0.05)\) for undirected graphs. The generator will generate undirected graphs by default.
 *
 * <p>
 * For deterministic behavior, set the seed of the generator using {@link #seed(long)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Based on 'R-MAT: A Recursive Model for Graph Mining' by Chakrabarti et al.
