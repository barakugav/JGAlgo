 * A listener that will be notified when an {@link IndexGraph} remove a vertex or an edge.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code int} identifiers an {@link IndexGraph} uses for its vertices are always {@code 0,1,2,...,verticesNum-1}
 * (and similarly for its edges). To maintain this invariant, when a vertex (or an edge) is removed from the graph, the
 * graph implementation way need to swap the identifiers of vertices (edges). If the index of the vertex (edge) is the
 * last index ({@code verticesNum-1}), the vertex can simply be removed. Otherwise, the vertex will be swapped with the
 * last vertex and then removed. It's possible to register to these swaps and removes using
 * {@link IndexGraph#addVertexRemoveListener(IndexRemoveListener)} and
 * {@link IndexGraph#addEdgeRemoveListener(IndexRemoveListener)}. The listener will be called on all vertex (edge)
 * removal functions except {@link IndexGraph#clear()} and {@link IndexGraph#clearEdges()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The same swap listener interface is used for both vertices and edges (a specific instance is only used to one of
 * them, which can be determined by the context), and we use a unified term <i>element</i> in the documentation to refer
 * to either of them.
