/**
 * A set of graph distance measures.
 *
 * <p>
 * Given a graph \(G=(V,E)\), and an edge weight function \(w:E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\), the eccentricity of a vertex
 * \(v \in V\) is the maximum distance from \(v\) to any other vertex in the graph. Multiple measures can be derived
 * from the eccentricity of the vertices, such as {@linkplain #radius() radius}, {@linkplain #diameter() diameter},
 * {@linkplain #center() center}, and {@linkplain #periphery() periphery}. A {@link DistanceMeasures} object can be
 * created for a graph using {@link #of(Graph, WeightFunction)}, and all these measures will be computed (possible
 * lazily).
