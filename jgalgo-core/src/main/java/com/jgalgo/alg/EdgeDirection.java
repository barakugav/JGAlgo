 * The direction type of an edge with respect to a vertex.

 * <p>
 * This enum is usually used as a parameter to algorithm that compute some property of the vertices related to their
 * edges. For example, the {@link CoresAlgo} compute the cores of the graph with respect to the degree of the vertices:
 * the degree can be in-degree, out-degree or in-degree + out-degree (not a real addition, as self edges are only count
 * once, see {@link #All}), determining different types of cores.
