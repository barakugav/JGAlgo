/**
 * Yen's algorithm for computing the K shortest paths between two vertices in a graph.
 *
 * <p>
 * This implementation is based on the paths compressed tree (the {@linkplain KShortestPathsSt2PathsTreeBased base
 * class}), which looks very different from the original algorithm, but it is indeed the same algorithm. This way of
 * maintaining the paths is more efficient than the original algorithm, and improvements such as Lawler's are not
 * necessary.
 *
 * <p>
 * The algorithms runs in \(O(nk(m+n \log n))\) time.
 *
