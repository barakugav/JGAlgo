/**
 * Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm.
 *
 * <p>
 * Given a graph, the traveling salesman problem asks what is the shortest tour that visit all the vertices and returns
 * to the starting vertex. The problem itself is NP-hard, but various approximation algorithms exists.
 *
 * <p>
 * The metric version of TSP is a special case in which the distances satisfy the triangle inequality and the distances
 * are symmetric.
