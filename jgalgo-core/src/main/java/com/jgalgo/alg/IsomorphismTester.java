 * Tester that check whether two graphs are isomorphic.
 *
 * <p>
 * Given two graphs, an isomorphism is a mapping function that maps the first graph vertices to the second graph
 * vertices, while preserving the structure of the graph. There are few variants of the problem:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Full</b>: Given two graphs \(G_1 = (V_1, E_1)\) and \(G_2 = (V_2, E_2)\), a full isomorphism is a
 * <b>bijective</b> function \(m: V_1 \rightarrow V_2\) such that \((u, v) \in E_1\) <b>if and only if</b> \((m(u),
 * m(v)) \in E_2\). In the case of a directed graph, the function must preserve the direction of the edges. Note that
 * full isomorphism can only exists between graphs with the same number of vertices and edges, as the vertex mapping is
 * bijective.</li>
 * <li><b>Induced subgraph</b>: Given two graphs \(G_1 = (V_1, E_1)\) and \(G_2 = (V_2, E_2)\), an induced subgraph
 * isomorphism is an <b>injective</b> function \(m: V_1 \rightarrow V_2\) such that \((u, v) \in E_1\) <b>if and only
 * if</b> \((m(u), m(v)) \in E_2\). In the case of a directed graph, the function must preserve the direction of the
 * edges. The first graph \(G_1\) is the smaller graph, and the second graph \(G_2\) is the bigger graph, namely there
 * is an induced sub graph of {@code g2} that is isomorphic to {@code g1}. Note that induced subgraph isomorphism can
 * only exists between graphs \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) if \(|V_1| \leq |V_2|\) and \(|E_1| \leq |E_2|\). There may be
 * vertices of \(G_2\) that are not mapped to any vertex of \(G_1\). Full isomorphism between two graphs can be seen as
 * a special case of induced subgraph isomorphism where the the number of vertices and edges is the same.</li>
 * <li><b>Subgraph</b>: Given two graphs \(G_1 = (V_1, E_1)\) and \(G_2 = (V_2, E_2)\), a subgraph isomorphism is an
 * <b>injective</b> function \(m: V_1 \rightarrow V_2\) such that if \((u, v) \in E_1\) <b>than</b> \((m(u), m(v)) \in
 * E_2\). In the case of a directed graph, the function must preserve the direction of the edges. The first graph
 * \(G_1\) is the smaller graph, and the second graph \(G_2\) is the bigger graph, namely there is a sub graph of
 * {@code g2} that is isomorphic to {@code g1}. Note that subgraph isomorphism can only exists between graphs \(G_1\)
 * and \(G_2\) if \(|V_1| \leq |V_2|\) and \(|E_1| \leq |E_2|\). There may be vertices of \(G_2\) that are not mapped to
 * any vertex of \(G_1\), and edges of \(G_2\) that are not mapped to any edge of \(G_1\) (even if they are connecting
 * mapped vertices of \(G_2\)).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * All the methods in this interface accept two graphs {@code g1} and {@code g2} and check for a <b>sub graph</b>
 * isomorphism between them, where {@code g1} is the smaller graph, and {@code g2} is the bigger graph. The methods
 * accept a {@code boolean} flag that indicates whether to search for a <i>sub graph</i> isomorphism or an <i>induced
 * sub graph</i> isomorphism. To check for a full isomorphism, use induced sub graph isomorphism and make sure that the
 * number of vertices of {@code g1} and {@code g2} are the same.
 *
 * <p>
 * The full isomorphism problem which asks whether two graphs are isomorphic is one of few standard problems in
 * computational complexity theory belonging to NP, but not known to belong to either of its well-known subsets: P and
 * NP-complete. The sub graph isomorphism variants are NP-complete.
