/**
 * A partition of the vertices of a graph.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A partition of a set is a division of the set into a number of disjoint subsets, such that their union is the
 * original set. The sets may also be called 'components' or 'blocks'. We use the term 'block' instead of 'set' to avoid
 * confusion with the get/set convention.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The partition represent a mapping from the vertices of a graph to \(B\) blocks, each block is assigned a number in
 * range \([0,B)\). To check to which block a vertex is assigned use {@link #vertexBlock(Object)}.
