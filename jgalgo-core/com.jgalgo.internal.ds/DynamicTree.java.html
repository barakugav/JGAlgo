/**
 * Dynamic tree data structure that support {@code link} and {@code cut} operations.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The dynamic tree data structure is a set of vertices forming a forest and support the following operations:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;{@link #makeTree()} - create a new vertex which will form a tree of size one.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;{@link #findRoot(Vertex)} - find the root vertex of a given vertex.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;{@link #link(Vertex, Vertex, double)} - link a vertex (root) to a parent with weighted edge.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;{@link #cut(Vertex)} - remove the edge from a vertex to its parent.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;{@link #addWeight(Vertex, double)} - add a weight to all edges on the path from a vertex to its tree root.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;{@link #findMinEdge(Vertex)} - find the edge with minimum weight from on the path from a vertex to its tree
 * root.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Note: this API will change in the future
 *
