/**
 * Minimum Vertex-Cut algorithm with terminal vertices (source-sink, S-T).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Given a graph \(G=(V,E)\), a vertex cut (or separating set) is a set of vertices \(C\) whose removal transforms \(G\)
 * into a disconnected graph. In case the graph is a clique of size \(k\), any vertex set of size \(k-1\) is considered
 * by convention a vertex cut of the graph. Given a vertex weight function, the weight of a vertex-cut \(C\) is the
 * weight sum of all vertices in \(C\). There are two variants of the problem to find a minimum weight vertex-cut: (1)
 * With terminal vertices, and (2) without terminal vertices. In the variant with terminal vertices, we are given two
 * special vertices {@code source (S)} and {@code sink (T)} and we need to find the minimum vertex-cut \(C\) such that
 * such that the {@code source} and the {@code sink} are not in the same connected components after the removal of the
 * vertices of \(C\). In the variant without terminal vertices (also called 'global vertex-cut') we need to find the
 * minimal cut among all possible cuts, and the removal of the vertices of \(C\) should simply disconnect the graph (or
 * make it trivial, containing a single vertex).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Algorithms implementing this interface compute the minimum vertex-cut given two terminal vertices, {@code source (S)}
 * and {@code sink (T)}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The cardinality (unweighted) minimum vertex-cut between two vertices is equal to the (local) vertex connectivity of
 * these two vertices. If the graph is directed, the vertex connectivity between \(u\) and \(v\) is the minimum of the
 * minimum vertex-cut between \(u\) and \(v\) and the minimum vertex-cut between \(v\) and \(u\).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Use {@link #newInstance()} to get a default implementation of this interface.
